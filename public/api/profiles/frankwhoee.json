	"about": "I find no greater satisfaction than in the process of creation: Creating art, cooking food, writing code. Our purpose on Earth is to see ourselves reflected in the products of our labour, so I hope that at the end of it all, when all is said and done, we will gaze upon the things we have built, the art that we have made, and the people that we have lovedâ€”and find ourselves there."
